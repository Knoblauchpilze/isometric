# isometric

Simple isometric application to explore the rendering problems associated to it.

# Installation

- Clone the repo: `git clone git@github.com:Knoblauchpilze/isometric.git`.
- Clone dependencies:
    * [core_utils](https://github.com/Knoblauchpilze/core_utils)
    * [maths_utils](https://github.com/Knoblauchpilze/maths_utils)
- Go to the project's directory `cd ~/path/to/the/repo`.
- Compile: `make run`.

Don't forget to add `/usr/local/lib` to your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to be able to load shared libraries at runtime. This is handled automatically when using the `make run` target (which internally uses the [run.sh](data/run.sh) script).
